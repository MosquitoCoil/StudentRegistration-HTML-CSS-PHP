            <b>Quezon City University</b> (formerly Quezon City Polytechnic University)
            <br>
            673 Quirino Highway, San Bartolome, Novaliches, Quezon City<br>
            <br>
            The Quezon City Polytechnic was created on March 1, 1994 by virtue of the City Council Ordinance No. SP-171 an institution to primarily undertake
            the training and development of qualified technicians and skilled workers.<br>
            <br>
            The Three-Year Technician Curriculum was introduced in the SY 1994-1995 designed to develop highly competent technicians for industry in the
            areas of Automotive Technology, Electrical Technology, Welding Technology, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Technology, and Fashion Technology.
            Added to the Three-Year Curriculum in the school year that followed were Electronics Technology, Mechanical Technology or Machine Shop, 
            Computer Technology and an industry-led pilot course in Boiler Technology.<br>
            <br>
            The QCPU established its reputation among local government units as a show window and model technology-based institution paving the way for its 
            recognition of the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) and developing a strong alliance with the Japan International
            Cooperation Agency (JICA).<br>
            <br>
            In 2001, Ordinance SP – 1030 created a charter for the establishment of Quezon City Polytechnic University. QCPU started its operation by offering 
            one (1) year programs and short term courses. By the year 2005, QCPU started offering college degree courses. Right now, QCPU prides itself in 
            providing employment to its graduates and serves as a tool for national development, particularly in Quezon City.<br>
            <br>
            Under the leadership of Mayor Feliciano Belmonte, Jr., starting SY 2005, meaningful access to higher education is now possible with a ladderized concept of pursuing higher education. The idea is that every person should have the opportunity for education and training commensurate to his abilities.
